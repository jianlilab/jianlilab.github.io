# <span style = "font-size: 70%"> Welcome to LDM Lab!

We are part of [the School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences](https://www.psy.pku.edu.cn/english/index.htm) and [the IDG McGovern Institute for Brain Research](https://mgv.pku.edu.cn/english/index.htm) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). 

Our research interests evolve around the questions regarding human learning, memory, and decision-making. We seek to quantitatively describe and understand their cognitive-neural machanisms by conducting behavioral, functional brain imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and pharmacological experiments.
