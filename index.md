# Welcome to Learning and Decision-making Lab!

We are part of the [School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences](http://psy.pku.edu/) at Peking University. 

Research in the lab is focused on discovering the fundamental principles of macromolecular structure and dynamics.  We are interested in defining conformational states that are essential for function and understanding how conformational transitions couple to biological mechanisms.

We are located in Wangkezhen Building at Peking University.
