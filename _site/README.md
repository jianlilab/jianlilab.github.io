If there's any suggestion about out website / any inquiry about further info, don't hesitate and please shoot an email to haoxuefan1997@gmail.com ! I am still trying to learn website construction, and I am looking forward to hearing from you :)

====================

This website was built using the Fraser Lab [website](http://fraserlab.com/) as a template.  James Fraser's website is open-source and available on [Github](https://github.com/fraser-lab/fraser-lab.github.io). 

====================

Technologies this website uses:  

```
Jekyll  
Github Pages  
Twitter Bootstrap 3.2  
```

Before pushing changes, please check that they will work on your system first with the plugins included in the Gemfile using the bundler tool (results served at [0.0.0.0:4000](0.0.0.0:4000)):

```
sudo gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

To push changes, navigate to the root directory of jianlilab.github.io and execute the following commands:

```terminal
git add --all .
git commit -m "version-specific note"
git push origin master
```
