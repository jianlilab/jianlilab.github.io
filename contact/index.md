Learning and Decisoin-making lab is a place filled with snacks, laughs and new ideas! If you are interested in working with us, please read below for details.

## Postdoctoral Fellows:

Inquiries about Postdoctoral positions should be emailed directly to Prof. Jian Li and clearly, but briefly, articulate why you are potentially interested in joining the lab. Candidates will be encouraged to explore applying for extramural fellowships to support their research.

## Prospective Graduate Student:

Our lab is accepting applications for 1-2 full time graduate students, to begin in Fall 2020. If interested, you can contact Prof. Jian Li directly by e-mail. A short-term research intern is strongly recommended before applying to our lab. 

## Undergraduate Student:

One main goal of the lab is to provide undergraduates opportunities with sufficient hands-on experience and help them grow into independent researchers. If interested, please send Prof. Jian Li an email including a bried self introduction and your research interest. We would get in touch with you soon!
